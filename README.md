This is a plugin for [AkashaCMS](http://akashacms.com) which generates navigation for a tree of documents.

To use it first install the module:

```shell
$ npm install @akashacms/plugins-booknav
```

The package `akashacms-booknav` is old and deprecated, and is replaced by this package.

It's recommended to use the tags provided by this plugin in the layout for `index.html` pages, and to treat `index.html` pages as an index of the documents in the current directory and child directories.

For example, a layout template `index-page.html.njk` could exist, and in `index.html.md` documents use that as the layout.  The core of this layout template would be:

```html
<article>
  <breadcrumb-trail/>
  {{ content }}
  <book-child-tree></book-child-tree>
</article>
```

This presentation shows the breadcrumb trail, as generated by `@akashacms/plugins-breadcrumbs`, any content, followed by a tree structure showing links to the documents in the tree.
